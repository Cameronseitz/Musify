## The problem or need that your proposed PWA addresses. Who are the target users and why would they use your app?
The problem we are addressing is the lack of personal input for music on major streaming services. You cannot rate and keep track of your favorite albums, artists, or tracks. Our PWA will let users give ratings for albums and songs as well as give reviews to track music you like. Our target audience are people who enjoy music and want to keep track of it. They would use our app because people like to try new ways to enjoy their favoite music. It is also popular to have rankings of albums within genres, which this app will facilitate. This is also streaming service-blind, meaning users of any platform can find
their music and formulate their thoughts of them. 

## The general features your application provides. What are the things users will be able to accomplish with your app? What data do you need for this to work and how will you get it?
Features:
- Users can search for artists, songs, and albums
- Users can rate and review their favoite albums, songs, and artists
- Users can view their ratings, grouped by genre, artist, or other filters
- Users can add albums and artists to a "listen list"
- Users can create their own playlists by adding songs
- Display a top chart of trending music by genre
- Send push notifications for when favorited artists drop new music

(Potential features depending on development schedule):
- Users can follow other users and look at their ratings
- Users can comment their thoughts below others'

For data, we will need an updated database of artists and their songs as well as trending music. To get this information, we will use an external api from https://www.last.fm/api.
